        <li>Galbi</li>
        <p>Galbi (Korean: 갈비) or kalbi, galbi-gui (갈비구이), or grilled ribs,is a type of gui (grilled dish) in Korean cuisine. 
            "Galbi" is the Korean word for "rib", and the dish is usually made with beef short ribs. 
            When pork spare ribs or another meat is used instead, the dish is named accordingly. 
            Galbi is served raw, then cooked on tabletop grills usually by the diners themselves.
            The dish may be marinated in a sweet and savory sauce usually containing soy sauce, garlic, and sugar. 
            Both non-marinated and marinated galbi are often featured in Korean barbecue.
            This and many other dishes in Korean barbecue influenced Yakiniku as seen in the use of galbi (coined as karubi).</p>

        <li>Jjigae</li>
        <p>jigae (Korean: 찌개, Korean pronunciation: [tɕ͈iɡɛ]) are Korean stews. 
            There are many varieties; they are typically made with meat, seafood or vegetables in a broth seasoned with 
            gochujang (red chilli paste), doenjang (soy bean paste), ganjang (soy sauce) or saeu-jeot (salted and fermented shrimp).
            Jjigae is often served as a communal dish.
            Korean meals often include either a jjigae or a guk. During the Joseon dynasty, it was known as jochi, 
            and two varieties would always be present on the King's surasang (royal cuisine).            
            The types of jjigae are often named according to their principal ingredients, such as saengseon jjigae (생선찌개; lit. fish jjigae) made from fish or dubu jjigae (두부찌개; lit. tofu jjigae). 
            They are also sometimes named according to their broth and seasonings, for example gochujang jjigae (고추장찌개) or doenjang-jjigae (된장찌개).</p>
